## GAME OBJECTIVE
The objective of this game is to remove all but one peg from the board by jumping diagonally over another peg to remove it. You can only move a peg diagnoally and it must 'jump' over another peg to remove it. You cannot move a peg to a free position if it does not 'jump' over another peg.

Be warned - a couple of bad moves can cost you the game!
