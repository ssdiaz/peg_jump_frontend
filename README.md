Hello & Welcome to my Peg Game Application! This is app features the game of Peg Solitaire, also known as the triangle game at Cracker Barrel.

This repo represents the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and communicates with a backend API built with Ruby on Rails stored in a separate repo (https://github.com/ssdiaz/peg_jump_backend_api). To run this application, please fork and clone this frontend repo and 'open index.html' in your webrowser. You also need to fork and clone the backend_api repo and run the Rails Server on that directory.


## GAME OBJECTIVE
The object of this game is to get all but one peg left removed from the board by selecting a peg and jumping over another diagonally. You can only move a peg diagnoally and it must have another peg to jump over to move. Be warned - a couple of bad moves can cost you the game!

Check out this link if you want to know how to win everytime: https://www.wikihow.com/Win-the-Peg-Game

Have Fun and Good Luck!
